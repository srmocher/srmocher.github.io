  <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>In my <a href="https://srmocher.github.io/2017/05/29/3d-scalar-fields.html">previous post</a>, I talked about visualizing 3D scalar fields using isosurfaces. A significant flaw with rendering as isosurfaces is that <strong>different possibilities</strong> (or rather regions of the surface) <strong>cannot be seen simultaneously</strong> as we observe the surface only for the selected isovalue.  In addition to this, an isosurface is assigned the same color and opacity values to every point on the isosurface obscuring internal regions. <em>Volume Rendering</em> is a technique which resolves this by making use of <em>transfer functions</em>.</p>

<h3 id="volume-rendering">Volume Rendering</h3>
<p>Volume Rendering (sometimes abbreviated as VR) is a direct visualization technique (in contrat to Isosurfaces), in that it tries to construct the surface directly from the data (rather than finding the triangles).  An example of a VR method is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_casting">raycasting</a>, which simulates rays passing through the data and then reconstructs the pixels based on ray intersections.</p>

<h3 id="transfer-function">Transfer function</h3>
<p>In simple terms, a transfer function <script type="math/tex">T</script> maps a scalar value <script type="math/tex">V</script> to a color-opacity pair <script type="math/tex">(C,\alpha)</script>. This is a 1-D transfer function since it takes only the scalar values into the account. Typically, a user assigns <script type="math/tex">(C,\alpha)</script> for a value, although there has been research on automated transfer functions. To discover interesting properties of a surface requires building a effective transfer function which in most cases requires a great deal of user interaction. A 1-D transfer function still has issues with ambiguous boundaries (lack of edge detection information).  To this end, we build an interface for a 2-D transfer function with interactive rendering side-by-side using VTK.</p>

<p>A 2-D transfer function T is then defined as the mapping below:</p>

<p><script type="math/tex">(V,G)</script> <script type="math/tex">\rightarrow</script> <script type="math/tex">(C,\alpha)</script></p>

<p>where <script type="math/tex">G = \sqrt{ \left( \frac{\partial V}{\partial x} \right)^{\!\!2} +  \left( \frac{\partial V}{\partial y} \right)^{\!\!2} +  \left( \frac{\partial V}{\partial z} \right)^{\!\!2}}</script>, which is the <strong>gradient magnitude</strong></p>

<p>Gradient magnitude represents the rate of change at a particular point and thus can be used to distinguish edges (where rate of change is higher).</p>

<p>We shall proceed now onto discussion of my implementation of a 2-D transfer function editor.</p>

<h3 id="interface">Interface</h3>

<p>A brief illustration of the interface and the interactions associated with it is shown below
 <img src="http://imageshack.com/a/img922/8650/b4I1bG.gif" alt="transfer function editor" /></p>

<p>There are 3 key widgets - one panel with a (log scaled) histogram of the scalar values versus the opacity on the Y-axis, one panel with the colormap ranging horizontally across the scalar values and finally a panel with a histogram (log scaled) of the gradient magnitudes versus Opacity. All the 3 widgets have capability to add “control points” - a mapping for the scalar/gradient value at that point to the color/opacity.</p>

<p>The window on the side renders the volume using VTK’s openGL rendering pipeline.  Each dimension (scalar value/gradient magnitude) corresponds to a <code class="highlighter-rouge">vtkPieceWiseFunction</code> object (<a href="http://www.vtk.org/doc/nightly/html/classvtkPiecewiseFunction.html">docs here</a>). The <code class="highlighter-rouge">vtkVolumeProperty</code> (<a href="http://www.vtk.org/doc/nightly/html/classvtkVolumeProperty.html">docs here</a>) class can be used to set the color/opacity for a particular point.</p>

<p>For the GUI widgets, I’ve used <a href="https://github.com/jvcleave/ofxImGui">ofxImGui</a> which is an openFrameworks addon for the neat C++ UI library <a href="https://github.com/ocornut/imgui">ImGui</a>.</p>

<p>The dataset being shown is for a car engine and we can get to see the interior parts of it by adding control points to the panels and appropriately adjusting the opacity by dragging them along the histogram.</p>

<p>The rendering is fairly slow as only raycasting is supported in Linux by VTK.</p>

<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<p>While the 2D transfer function offers more options fo the user, this also can become cumbersome especially if lot of customization is required with regard to the widgets. This is the trade-off when we increase the dimensionality.  Dimensionality also increases the computational intensiveness of rendering and interactivity as observed above. A 3D transfer function is also possible by including the second derivate of the scalar values.</p>
