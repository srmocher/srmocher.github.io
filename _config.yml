  Hi, I'm Sridhar. I'm a staff software engineer specializing in developer productivity, build systems, and polyglot development at scale. I have deep expertise in Bazel, CI/CD optimization, and have made significant open-source contributions to the JVM/Kotlin ecosystem.

  My work spans across multiple languages (Go, Kotlin, TypeScript, Python) and focuses on solving complex infrastructure challenges in large monorepos. I'm passionate about creating tools that make developers more productive.

  Note: If you're a recruiter hiring for a company from the US, please reach out only if you sponsor work visas. It will save my time and yours. :)

        sub_title: VSCode Extension
        caption: Published on Visual Studio Marketplace
        description: |
          Created a VSCode extension that adds Bazel support to the Kotlin language server, enabling better IDE integration for Kotlin projects built with Bazel. This extension improves developer experience by providing proper language support, navigation, and error reporting in Bazel-managed Kotlin codebases.

        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          Right out of college, I joined a rotational program at Microsoft that allowed me to work in 2 different roles (Service Engineer/Software Engineer) that allowed me exposure to enterprise-scale infrastructure and services in the Universal Store Team. I worked on improving the reliability and availability of the OEM application suite through disaster recovery automation across datacenters. As an SWE, I built a number of features that enabled hybrid connectivity (cloud/on-premise) for B2B message processing for orders between Microsoft and OEM/volume licensing partners.
