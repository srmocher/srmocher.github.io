  Hi, I'm Sridhar. I'm a generalist software engineer interested in solving problems at scale. I've worked on diverse domains - whether it's autonomous vehicle simulation infrastructure, improving developer experience for 5000+ engineers or enabling B2B integration between large businesses on cloud and hybrid infrastructure.

        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
                LinkedIn engineers use a wide array of in-house tools in their day-to-day workflow. I worked on making the lives of the owners of these tools easier by building improved support experience for these tools and enabling a continuous feedback system that engineers could use to provide their voice.

                Autonomous Vehicle engineers need reliable systems that allow them to run simulations, analyze results and iterate on their features in this development cycle. I worked on these systems and the services that encompassed it. I also worked on Continuous Integration (CI) infrastructure that allowed engineers to push their code changes quickly and reliably.

          Working on enterprise B2B legacy codebase was a learning experience right out of college.
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
                Right out of college, I joined a rotational program at Microsoft that allowed me to work in 2 different roles (Service Engineer/Software Engineer) that allowed me exposure to enterprise-scale infrastructure and services in the Universal Store Team. I worked on improving the reliability and availability of the OEM application suite through disaster recovery automation across datacenters. As an SWE, I built a number of features that enabled hybrid connectivity (cloud/on-premise) for B2B message processing for orders between Microsoft and OEM/volume licensing partners.

          Learned the ropes of basic CS, did some projects and used it as a platform for my entry in the industry.

      Alongside my interest in software engineering some of my other interests and hobbies are:
      - Hiking
      - Soccer
      - Board games

      This happens to be the most beautiful place I've ever visited so far (guess where it is?)
